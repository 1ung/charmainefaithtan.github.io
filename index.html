					<h2>The biggest adventure you can take <br />

					<p>
						Years of being a target of bully in early childhood did not make bring my self-esteem down . What I learned was
						to always treat one another with kindness and the universe will take care of your emotional well-being.
						<p>
							At the same time, I have coped with my problems by travelling (sweet escape) , experiencing more of this world,
							and with personal development.
						</p>
						<p>
							Faith , perhaps my name is a constant reminder for me to believe in what this world holds for me.
						</p>
						<p>
							P.S. You'll probably find me a little more mature than most my age.

					<h2>I ventured into the world of dating apps. Got Lost.</h2>
					<p class="storyText">
						3 minutes in to a dating app was all it took to receive so many messages I am unable to deal with it. That's
						what. dating apps for a girl is.I might be naive to think this but maybe the right one could be somewhere in the
						crowd. For now it is not an exaggeration to say I'm finding a needle in a haystack. So dear, if you are out
						there
						why do you think you're not getting my response?
					</p>
					<p class="storyText">
						I wasn't always decent looking so guys never talked to me much. My peers would have chided me if they knew how
						uncomfortable I felt over my own appearance. However, a friend played a part to influence me to be bolder and
						over time that boosted my confidence and perceived value of myself. Passive self-consciousness allowed me to do
						what it takes to look and feel better. Make-overs, healthy eating, persistent gym sessions. To me it was all
						worth it because I am confident the way I am now and it doesn't hurt that a just decent looking girl could get
						all the attention she needs. (hehe)

				<div class="content">
					<p class="storyText">To all the guys who are on dating apps, this is not to downplay your effort. I have been
						there so I'm
						flattered
						by your messages even if it takes me forever to reply but maybe you need to work on your game or even in your
						own
						life so you could get a better chance to date a girl. Of course there are those of you who treat this as a
						really
						casual past time. Carry on with what you are doing in life &#9786;</p>
					<p class="storyText">Now we got that out of the way, around my suave guys don't come easy online. Offering money
						does not work
						because dozens of others say the same crap. Even a shameless woman would even be weary before accepting an offer
						from a stranger. And lets face it, you look like a total DOOF doing that. We are no longer hesitant to share
						your
						attempt of harassment online (yes perverted texts are also a form of sexual harassment).</p>

					<p class="storyText">So dear, instead of offering me cash for porn, sex or nudes which would never work, I would
						prefer a suave guy
						to sweep me off my feet. Let me offer you some ways you could learn to do just that. Please do not to click on
						the link if you are happy with your dating success now. I'm sure there are many girls who would be a better fit
						for you but as of now I am getting bored of this dating apps. There are many ways but here are two shameless
						affiliate but suitable materials to learn from.</p>
